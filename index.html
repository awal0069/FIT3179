    <h2>Earth's Environmental Wellbeing</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="passage-bubble">
    <p>Earth's environmental wellbeing is increasingly at risk due to the combined effects of deforestation, rising carbon dioxide emissions, and escalating air pollution. Large-scale forest loss reduces the planet's capacity to absorb CO₂, intensifying global warming and disrupting ecosystems. Elevated CO₂ levels from industrial activity, transport, and energy production contribute to climate change, while harmful air pollutants such as particulate matter and nitrogen oxides degrade air quality and endanger human health. These interconnected issues weaken biodiversity, disrupt weather patterns, and strain natural resources, emphasizing the urgent need for coordinated global action to promote sustainable development and restore ecological balance.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="passage-bubble">
  <p>The map below shows a general increase in deforestation between the years of 1990 and 2015. Trends indicate that as societies have grown more environmentally conscious in recent years, deforestation rates have slowed — with some countries such as Costa Rica abd Russia reportedly eliminating deforestation entirely by 2015.</p>

  <!-- Regional Analysis Bubbles -->
  <div class="regional-grid">
    <div class="region-bubble">
      <h3>Africa</h3>
      <p>Many countries show consistent, often sharp declines. Angola fell from about 63.6% to 53.4%, and Côte d'Ivoire from 24.3% to 8.8%. The declines reflect pressures from agriculture, logging, and land-use change.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="region-bubble">
      <h3>Asia</h3>
      <p>Trends are mixed but mostly negative. Indonesia dropped from 62% to 48% and Cambodia from 60.8% to 44.6%. China is a clear exception, rising from 16.4% to 23% due to large-scale afforestation.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="region-bubble">
      <h3>Europe</h3>
      <p>The region is generally stable or improving. Albania shows a slight recovery after an initial decline, while Austria, Finland, and France recorded modest gains driven by sustainable forestry and reforestation.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="region-bubble">
      <h3>North America and Central America</h3>
      <p>Forest cover is stable in parts of North America, while Central American and Caribbean countries such as Honduras, Belize, and Guatemala show steady declines tied to agricultural expansion and urbanization.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="region-bubble">
      <h3>South America</h3>
      <p>Losses are pronounced. Brazil fell from 69.2% to 58.3%, with Bolivia and Argentina also recording major reductions driven by cattle ranching and soy cultivation.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="region-bubble">
      <h3>Oceania</h3>
      <p>Overall pattern is mixed but generally declining. Australia remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, while several Pacific island nations experienced notable declines.</p>

  <!-- New passage connecting deforestation to CO2 emissions -->
  <div class="passage-bubble">
    <p>Rising deforestation in past decades has weakened Earth's capacity to absorb carbon dioxide by removing and degrading vast carbon sinks. Trees that once fixed CO2 through photosynthesis were cut or burned, releasing stored carbon and reducing future uptake as regrowth lags or is prevented by land conversion. Soil disturbance and loss of biomass further diminished long-term carbon sequestration, while fragmented and degraded forests store far less carbon per hectare than intact ecosystems. As a result, the terrestrial biosphere shifted from buffering emissions toward contributing additional CO2. This loss of sink strength coincided with accelerating fossil fuel combustion and industrial activity, so atmospheric CO2 concentrations have risen steadily as shown below. Reduced natural uptake magnified the effect of emissions, lengthening CO2's atmospheric residence and increasing radiative forcing. Higher CO2 levels follow both direct emissions from clearing and the diminished capacity of land to absorb continuing emissions, driving the observed long-term increase in global atmospheric CO2.</p>

  <div class="passage-bubble">
    <p>CO2 emissions have grown exponentially since the Industrial Revolution, driven by coal, oil, and gas combustion across expanding industrial and transport systems. Annual global emissions have climbed to an all-time high exceeding 35 billion tonnes of CO2 per year and continue to rise. The geographic pattern of emissions has shifted dramatically over recent decades. In 1990 the United States was the dominant emitter, responsible for roughly 22.5% of global CO2 from 195 countries. Since then industrialization and energy-intensive development have propelled China to the forefront; by 2023 China accounted for about 31.5% of global CO2 emissions, a share larger than that of all other Asian countries combined. This reallocation of emissions between regions increases the importance of global cooperation on decarbonization, technology transfer, and emissions reductions to prevent further growth in atmospheric CO2 and associated climate impacts.</p>
